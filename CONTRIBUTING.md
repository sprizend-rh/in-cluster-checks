## Adding New Rules

To add a new validation rule:

### 1. Create the Rule Class

Create a new rule in the appropriate domain directory (e.g., `src/in_cluster_checks/rules/hw/`):

```python
from in_cluster_checks.core.rule import Rule
from in_cluster_checks.core.rule_result import RuleResult
from in_cluster_checks.utils.enums import Objectives, Status


class YourNewRule(Rule):
    """Brief description of what this rule validates."""

    # Define which nodes this rule applies to
    objective_hosts = [Objectives.ALL_NODES]  # or MASTERS, WORKERS, etc.

    def set_document(self):
        """Set rule metadata."""
        self.unique_name = "your_new_rule"  # Must be unique!
        self.title = "Human-readable rule title"

    def run_rule(self):
        """Execute the validation logic."""
        # Run command on the node
        return_code, stdout, stderr = self.run_cmd("your-command")

        # Parse output and determine pass/fail
        if return_code == 0:
            return RuleResult.passed("Validation passed")
        else:
            return RuleResult.failed(f"Validation failed: {stderr}")
```

### 2. Add Rule to Domain

Add your rule to the appropriate domain in `src/in_cluster_checks/domains/`:

```python
from in_cluster_checks.rules.hw.your_file import YourNewRule

class HWValidationDomain(RuleDomain):
    def get_rule_classes(self) -> List[type]:
        return [
            # ... existing rules ...
            YourNewRule,  # Add your rule here
        ]
```

### 3. Write Tests

Create tests in `tests/rules/`:

```python
def test_your_new_rule():
    """Test your new rule."""
    rule = YourNewRule()
    # Test with mock data
    # Assert expected behavior
```

### 4. Run Tests

```bash
pytest tests/rules/hw/test_your_new_rule.py -v
```

## Adding New Domains

To add a new domain:

### 1. Create Domain Class

Create a new file in `src/in_cluster_checks/domains/`:

```python
from typing import List
from in_cluster_checks.core.domain import RuleDomain


class YourNewDomain(RuleDomain):
    """Description of this validation domain."""

    def domain_name(self) -> str:
        """Return unique domain name."""
        return "your_domain"

    def get_rule_classes(self) -> List[type]:
        """Return list of rule classes in this domain."""
        return [
            # List your domain's rules here
        ]
```

### 2. Create Rule Directory

Create directory structure:
```
src/in_cluster_checks/rules/your_domain/
├── __init__.py
└── your_validations.py
```

### 3. The Runner Will Auto-Discover It

The `InClusterCheckRunner` automatically discovers all domains in the `domains` package - no manual registration needed!

## Testing Your Changes

### Manual Testing

Test your changes manually using the CLI or programmatically:

```bash
# Using CLI with debug mode to test a specific rule
openshift-checks --debug-rule your_rule_name

# Or test programmatically
python -c "
from in_cluster_checks.runner import InClusterCheckRunner
from pathlib import Path

runner = InClusterCheckRunner(
    debug_rule_flag=True,
    debug_rule_name='your_rule_name',
)
runner.run(output_path=Path('./test-results.json'))
"
```

**Debug Mode Features:**
- Only runs the specified rule
- Shows detailed command execution output
- Disables secret filtering for easier debugging
- Disables JSON output (shows results in console)

### Automated Testing

### Run All Tests

```bash
pytest
```

### Run Specific Test File

```bash
pytest tests/rules/hw/test_hw_validations.py -v
```

### Run with Coverage

```bash
pytest --cov=src/in_cluster_checks --cov-report=term-missing
```

### Coverage Requirements

- Minimum coverage: **80%**
- All new code should have tests
- Pre-commit hooks enforce coverage requirements

## Code Style

### Tools

We use the following tools (enforced by pre-commit):

- **black**: Code formatting (line length: 120)
- **flake8**: Linting
- **isort**: Import sorting
- **Custom linter**: No imports inside functions

### Pre-commit Hooks

Pre-commit hooks run automatically on `git commit`. To run manually:

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

### Python Style Guidelines

- **Line length**: 120 characters
- **Import order**: stdlib, third-party, local (managed by isort)
  - Group imports with blank lines between categories
  - **ALWAYS place all imports at the top of the file** - never add imports inside functions
- **Docstrings**: Use Google-style docstrings
- **Type hints**: Use type hints where appropriate (Python 3.12+)
- **Naming**:
  - Classes: `PascalCase`
  - Functions/methods: `snake_case`
  - Constants: `UPPER_CASE`
  - Private: prefix with `_`

### Code Quality Guidelines

#### Comments

**Only add comments when the code is hard to understand without them.**

- Don't add comments that restate what the code does
- Don't add comments for self-explanatory code or obvious operations
- Only add comments to explain complex algorithms, non-obvious workarounds, or important design decisions

**Examples of unnecessary comments (avoid these):**
```python
self._lock = threading.Lock()  # Prevent parallel execution (obvious from code)
with self._lock:  # Use lock (obvious from context)
self.node_name = node_name  # Set node name (restates what code does)
```

#### Conditional Checks

**Avoid redundant None checks when checking truthiness.**

```python
# Good - concise and Pythonic
if not results:
    return []

# Bad - redundant check
if results is None or not results:
    return []
```

In Python, `not variable` evaluates to `True` for `None`, empty lists `[]`, empty strings `""`, empty dicts `{}`, `0`, and `False`.

#### DRY Principle

**NEVER duplicate logic across multiple files or functions.** Follow the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.

When you find similar code in multiple places:
1. Identify the common logic
2. Extract it to a single location (utility function, base class method, etc.)
3. Have all callers use the shared implementation

**Benefits:**
- Changes only need to be made in one place
- Consistent behavior across all code paths
- Easier to test and maintain
- Better separation of concerns

### Example

```python
from typing import List

from in_cluster_checks.core.rule import Rule


class MyNewRule(Rule):
    """
    Brief one-line description.

    Longer description if needed. Explain what this rule validates
    and why it's important.

    Returns:
        RuleResult: Validation result with pass/fail status
    """

    objective_hosts = [Rule.Objectives.ALL_NODES]

    def set_document(self):
        """Set rule metadata."""
        self.unique_name = "my_new_rule"
        self.title = "My New Validation Rule"

    def run_rule(self):
        """Execute validation logic."""
        return_code, stdout, stderr = self.run_cmd("echo 'test'")
        return Rule.RuleResult.passed("Validation passed")
```
